Welcome to EasyMOBA version 0.1f (16 February 2017) Unity Version: Unity2017.3

This guide will help you to first-running EasyMOBA Game Client & Server.

This is the Game Client project you have downloaded from Unity Asset Store.

You can see the server file (ServerProject.zip) in your project. That's the server. It's a different Unity Project.
You should extract that zip and open with Unity.

When you run the two projects, they can connect each other.
The game client connects always 127.0.0.1 (Local server) because of the settings.json file you can find it in your Resources folder.
But there is a different method, an input field is placed on your UI for debugging.
If you enter a custom ip into that input field while on playing, the game client will connect to that address.

Sincerely,
EasyMOBA Team
